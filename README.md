# Bouncy
A simple toy project where balls fly around and bounce off each other. Collision physics are implemented using vector math (see docs). Collisions are far from perfect, balls can for example get stuck inside lines :-)

## Build & Run
```
1. npm install
2. npm run build-game
3. Open build/index.html
```

# Preview
Note, actual code will run at 60 FPS. This is an extremely low FPS gif file.
