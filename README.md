# Bouncy
A simple toy project where balls fly around and bounce off each other. Collision physics are implemented using vector math (see docs). Collisions are far from perfect, balls can for example get stuck inside lines :-)
An (extremely low FPS) preview can be seen in the Preview section. Note it will actually run at 60 FPS.

## Build & Run
```
1. npm install
2. npm run build-game
3. Open build/index.html
```
